# Bowling Game

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for a Bowling Game.

## Instructions

The `Main.java` file contains the source code for the entry point of the project.
This project was developed and tested using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

The game will first ask for the number of players. After entering the number, press `Enter`.

Then, for each player, input `y` to indicate that the player will be controlled by a human player, or press `Enter` 
to indicate that the player will be controlled by the Computer.

The bowling game contains 10 rounds, each round human-controlled players will be given the opportunity to "throw" the
bowling ball using the `Enter` key. Based on the number of pins taken down, the score of the player will be updated.

At the end of the game, the leaderboard will be displayed, and the winning player will be printed in the terminal.
